  <h1>👋 Yo, I'm Tymur</h1>
  <p>I make games, sometimes break them, and hate meta questions with a passion.</p>

  <h2>🚫 Meta Questions Suck</h2>
  <p>Don't ask “Can I ask something?” or “Is it okay to ask about X?”</p>
  <p><strong>Just ask the goddamn question.</strong> If it’s dumb, we’ll tell you. But wasting time with a meta-question is worse.</p>

  <h2>💥 Why Meta Questions Are Bad</h2>
  <p><strong>1. They waste time:</strong> Every second spent on "Can I ask something?" is a second lost. People tune out.</p>
  <p><strong>2. They add no value:</strong> Meta questions don't contain useful info. They're just noise in the signal.</p>
  <p><strong>3. They block the flow:</strong> Conversations stall while everyone waits for you to say the actual thing.</p>
  <p><strong>4. They confuse noobs:</strong> Beginners see meta questions and think it's the norm. It lowers the quality of future questions.</p>
  <p><strong>5. They invite spam:</strong> Instead of useful answers, you get “yes?”, “go ahead”, or nothing at all.</p>
  <p><strong>6. They’re insecure as hell:</strong> If you're asking permission to speak, you're not confident. Just speak up and let the answer sort itself out.</p>
